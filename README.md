# NLP Project

- This is our first project using NLP, and we are working in pairs. 

## Goal
- For this project, you will be scraping data from GitHub repository README files. The goal will be to build a model that can predict what programming language a repository is, given the text of the README file.

## Deliverables
- A well-documented jupyter notebook that contains your analysis
One or two google slides suitable for a general audience that summarize your findings. Include a well-labelled visualization in your slides.


## Audience: 
- General Audience

## Exploration
- Here are some ideas for our exploration based on the data we scraped:

- What are the most common words in READMEs?
- What does the distribution of IDFs look like for the most common words?
- Does the length of the README vary by programming language?
- Do different programming languages use a different number of unique words?

## Want to run this yourself? You need...
- You can use our acquire.py and prepare.py files to recreate our notebook.
- Our Jupyter Notebook
- a env.py file with host, user, and password and a github token.
